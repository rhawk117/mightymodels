"""The plugin data directory, where the state database is kept, and how each edge learns it.

Claude Code sets `PLUGIN_DATA_VARIABLE` for the plugin's MCP server and for its hook commands, and
for nothing started through the Bash tool. So the SessionStart hook writes the directory into the
session's env file under `SESSION_DATA_VARIABLE`, a name of this plugin's own, and `verify run`
reads that one. The env file is shared by every plugin, and a second plugin exporting
`PLUGIN_DATA_VARIABLE` there would otherwise point the command at its directory.

Each edge reads exactly one of the two and there is no fallback from one to the other. An unset
or empty variable is the absence the edge refuses on, naming the variable.

This module loads no database or server package: the hook command imports it.
