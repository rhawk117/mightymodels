"""The state database in the plugin data directory: one engine and one session factory per owner.

Whoever opens it holds it for as long as it runs, the server for its lifespan and `verify run`
for its one command, and the engine is disposed when that owner lets go. The file is
`DATABASE_NAME` in the plugin data directory, outside every repository, and it holds the rows of
all of them. A `Database` is that file as one repository sees it: it carries the repository's key,
and each domain's repository writes and reads rows under that key and no other. Deleting the file
resets the state of every repository.

`open_database` is the only way to a `Database`, and it creates the table of every row type in
`ROW_TYPES` by name, whatever else the owner has imported. So no owner opens a database with a
table missing, and a domain's `tables.py` adds a table only by adding its row type here.

The file is stamped with `SCHEMA_VERSION`, kept in SQLite's `user_version`. A file that holds
nothing is stamped before its tables are created. A file with any other stamp is refused by name
and left as it was: there is no migration, and tables of another shape would be read wrong. An
unstamped file that already holds tables is such a file, and a database an earlier version kept
inside a repository is one.

SQLite checks a foreign key only on a connection that asks it to, so every connection of the
engine asks as it opens. A row whose parent is missing is then refused when its transaction
commits.

Every session of every repository writes this one file, so it is kept in SQLite's write-ahead
log mode, where a read does not wait for a write, and every connection waits `BUSY_TIMEOUT`, ten
seconds, for another session's write before its own is refused as locked. A transaction holds
rows only and no command runs inside one, so a wait is as long as the commits queued ahead, and
ten seconds covers several of them on a slow disk while a call still answers. The mode is kept in
the file's header and setting it writes the file, so it is set only once the stamp is accepted:
a refused file is not written at all. While a session has the file open, a `-wal` and a `-shm`
file sit beside it.

No read returns more rows as a repository's history grows, and none answers from a part of what
it was asked for without saying so. A `ReadLimit` is the most rows one read returns, and the read
asks for one row more to learn whether there were more. A read of everything a ticket, a run or an
investigation holds is refused with `ReadLimitError` once there are more. A read of a repository's
history returns its newest rows as a `Latest`, which says whether older ones were left out.

A write is held to the limit of the read that returns its rows, so nothing the plugin stores makes
a ticket, a run or an investigation unreadable. A repository writes its rows, counts what the
owner then holds and raises `WriteLimitError` when that is past the limit, which rolls the
transaction back: a refused batch stores none of its rows. The count is read after the write on
purpose. The driver begins SQLite's transaction at a session's first write and not at a read
before it, so only a count taken after the write is read under the write lock, where no other
session can add a row between the count and the commit.
