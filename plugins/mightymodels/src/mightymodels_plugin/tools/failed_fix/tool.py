"""The `failed_fix` tool: records a fix that failed, through the task service that counts them.

It is a tool of its own so that an engineer, whose `tools:` names this one and not `task`, cannot
start, verify or mark a task. The count, its limit and its refusal stay in the task service.

`ResolvedTasks` is a plain assignment because the SDK does not see a `Resolve` marker behind a
PEP 695 `type` alias and would put the parameter in the tool's schema.
