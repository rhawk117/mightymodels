"""The `investigation` tool: each handler checks the call's arguments and asks the service.

Every action but `start` and `list` works on one investigation, and `investigation_for` is the
one place that refuses a call that names none. `knowns` reads the whole table when the call
carries no filter.

`start` asks the user for the kind of target when the request leaves it out, through `AskedKind`.
`ServedInvestigation` holds the service and the answer, which a tool's argument limit leaves no
room to take as two parameters.

`ResolvedInvestigations` is a plain assignment because the SDK does not see a `Resolve` marker
behind a PEP 695 `type` alias and would put the parameter in the tool's schema.
