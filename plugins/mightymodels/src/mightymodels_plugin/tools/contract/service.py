"""The contract service: the commands a ticket may run to prove its work, and `verify run`.

`approve` records the commands the user approved, and an approved id never changes its argv.
`status` reads each command's latest receipt against the current HEAD. `run_approved` is
`verify run`: it takes ids only and looks each one up in the ticket's contract, so nothing outside
what the user approved runs through it. It reads the commands in one transaction, runs them with
no transaction open, and records a receipt for every run in a second.

The service is built once by whoever owns the workspace and the database, the server in its
lifespan and the `verify run` command for its one run, and holds both. A method opens a
transaction through `contract_transaction`, which hands it the repository. Everything above the
class reads no service state. The command line imports this module, so nothing it imports may
load `mcp`.
