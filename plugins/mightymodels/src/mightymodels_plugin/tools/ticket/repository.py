"""The ticket rows, reached only through a repository that holds one transaction's session.

`ticket_transaction` opens a transaction on the database and hands out the repository, so the
ticket service never sees a session. A domain that reads ticket rows inside its own transaction
builds a `TicketRepository` on that transaction's session. The repository holds the key of the
git repository the database was opened for, and reads and writes rows under that key only.

A closed ticket is final. `unclosed_row` hands out the row of a ticket that still takes work and
refuses a closed one, and `mark_in_progress` writes through it, so no closed ticket reads in
progress again.

A ticket links investigations by id, and `unrecorded_investigations` says which of them have no
ledger, read through the investigation repository on the same session.
