"""The questions `ticket` puts to the user when `write` leaves the scope, compaction or branch out.

The branch answer is the current checkout or a new branch; a new one carries its name, and
`TicketService.branch_named` turns the answer into the name that is written. A caller that asked
the user itself passes the branch name on the fields.

The `Asked...` names are plain assignments because the SDK does not see a `Resolve` marker behind
a PEP 695 `type` alias and would put the parameter in the tool's schema.
