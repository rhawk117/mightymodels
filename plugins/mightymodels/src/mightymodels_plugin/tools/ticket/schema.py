"""Arguments and results of the `ticket` tool.

A `LinkedInvestigation` is the id of an investigation as a caller names it. It is held to a slug's
length here, and `validate` refuses one that is not a slug.

`TicketRequest` is the interview as a caller fills it in, and may leave out the scope, the
compaction and the branch, which the tool then asks the user. `TicketAnswers` is the complete form
the service writes.
