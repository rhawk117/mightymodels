"""The `ticket` tool: each handler checks the call's arguments and asks the ticket service.

`write` asks the user for the scope, the compaction and the branch when the fields leave them out,
through the resolvers in `questions`. `ServedTicket` holds the service and the answers, which a
tool's argument limit leaves no room to take as separate parameters.

`ResolvedTickets` is a plain assignment because the SDK does not see a `Resolve` marker behind a
PEP 695 `type` alias and would put the parameter in the tool's schema.
