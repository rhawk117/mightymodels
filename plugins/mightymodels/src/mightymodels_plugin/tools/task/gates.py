"""The two gates of the task domain: what keeps a task from verified and a ticket from ready.

A task is proven only when the reported commit is the current HEAD and descends from the task's
base, every contract command for it passed at that HEAD, its DONE brief names the commit, every
other acceptance criterion carries a citation, and the commit touched only the files the task
owns. A ticket is ready only when a plan task has been started, every plan task is closed, no
fix is stuck and every live contract command passed at HEAD.

Each function returns its problems as the lines the caller shows, and an empty list is a pass.
They read git, the brief file and rows the caller already holds, and never the database.
