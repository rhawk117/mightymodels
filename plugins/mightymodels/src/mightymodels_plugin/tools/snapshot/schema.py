"""Arguments and results of the `snapshot` tool.

`SnapshotRecord` is the JSON baton-pass writes beside the Markdown, held once in the view. The
tool takes no action from the model: `SnapshotAction` has the one member its handler is filed
under, and the schema does not show it.

`NotYetRecorded` is the type of a section the database holds nothing for yet. It reads empty and
admits no entry.
