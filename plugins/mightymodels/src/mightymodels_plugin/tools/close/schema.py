"""Arguments and results of the `close` tool.

`Closing` is what the user says about the ticket as it closes. `ArchiveRecord` is the JSON
prune-ticket writes beside the archive Markdown, and `ClosedArchive` carries both texts with
their paths. `ArchivedDecision` is one live decision of an investigation the ticket links, held
to one line, with the investigation and the entry it came from under `from`. The record's worker
runs and recorded answers read empty: the database holds no row for them yet.
