"""The `close` tool: each handler checks the call's arguments and asks the close service.

`check` needs the ticket only. `close` also needs the closing, what the user says the ticket
shipped, and `close_ticket` is the one place that refuses a call without it.

`ResolvedClosings` is a plain assignment because the SDK does not see a `Resolve` marker behind a
PEP 695 `type` alias and would put the parameter in the tool's schema.
