"""The scout-report spool: files a process outside the server leaves for it to take in.

The spool is the directory `SPOOL_DIRECTORY` in the plugin data directory, which every repository
shares. A report is one file in it named `<digest>-<unique part>.json`, whose content is a JSON
object with exactly these keys:

    {"repository_key": "owner/name", "scout": "code-scout", "target": "...", "report": "..."}

`scout` is `code-scout` or `web-scout`, `target` is at most `NAME_LIMIT` characters and `report`
is non-blank text of at most `REPORT_LIMIT`, which leaves room for the other keys in a file of
`SPOOL_FILE_BYTES`. A writer creates the file under a name that does not end in `.json` and
renames it to one that does, so the server never reads half a report.

`<digest>` is the SHA-256 hex digest of the repository key's text in UTF-8, and
`spool_file_prefix` in `repository_key.py` gives `<digest>-` for a key, so a writer names its file
`spool_file_prefix(key)` followed by a unique part and `.json`. A server lists only the names that
begin with its own prefix: a file of another repository costs it nothing and cannot starve it, and
a file under any other name is never opened, read or moved.

The key is in the file as well, so a file under this repository's digest whose content names
another key is set aside, and so is a file it cannot take in, because it is over
`SPOOL_FILE_BYTES`, is not a report, or holds text that redaction lengthens past its column. A
file set aside is moved to `REJECTED_DIRECTORY` inside the spool under a name of its own and
kept. Every path is the data directory, a fixed name, the digest and the writer's unique part: no
key is ever part of a path.

A call takes in at most `SPOOL_FILES_PER_CALL` files, oldest name first.
