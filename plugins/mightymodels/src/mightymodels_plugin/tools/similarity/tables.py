"""The `similarity` and `scout_reports` tables, and the FTS5 index over the first.

A similarity row is the text of one ledger entry, scout report, review finding or crashout, with
the kind it came from and a reference to its source row. A kind and a reference name one row of a
repository, so a text written again under the same reference replaces the row's text. A scout
report row is a report as a scout wrote it, and it has a similarity row of its own.

`similarity_index` is an FTS5 index with no copy of the text: it reads the `text` column of
`similarity` as its content. SQLite does not keep an external-content index current, so three
triggers carry every insert, update and delete of a similarity row into the index, and a row
leaves the index in the statement that deletes it. The index, its triggers and FTS5's own tables
are created by the DDL below after the tables of `Base.metadata`, which `database.py` creates
only once the schema stamp is accepted. Each statement is `IF NOT EXISTS`, so a file whose tables
were made but whose index was not gets the index at the next open.

FTS5 keeps one set of term statistics for the whole index, which holds the text of every
repository, so every read of it joins `similarity` and filters on the repository key.
