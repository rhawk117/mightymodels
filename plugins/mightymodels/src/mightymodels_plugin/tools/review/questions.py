"""The questions `review` puts to the user when a call leaves the answer out.

`start` asks the scope, the depth and the emphasis of whatever the payload leaves out. `dispose`
asks what to do with the one finding its payload names when it carries no decisions, and stores
that one decision. The persona of a quick balanced review is not asked: the skill lists no choices
for it.

`AskedScope` and the other `Asked...` names are plain assignments because the SDK does not see a
`Resolve` marker behind a PEP 695 `type` alias and would put the parameter in the tool's schema.
