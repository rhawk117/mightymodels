"""Findings from persona reports: validated in full, redacted, merged by location, numbered.

Every reported severity is stored on the one ladder (a Blocker is High). An incoming finding
whose location overlaps a recorded one on the same file merges into it: the sources join, the
higher severity wins, and a gap of two levels or more records a conflict for the user to decide.
