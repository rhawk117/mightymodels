"""What every table of the state database is declared from.

A domain declares its rows in its own `tables.py` from this base and these column types, and
`database.py` names every row type it creates a table for.

Every row type has a `repository_key` column, because one database holds the rows of every
repository. It leads the primary key of a table keyed by names, so the same slug, task id, run id
or investigation id is a different row in another repository. A table keyed by a serial number
carries it as a plain column that leads an index, and the number orders the rows of one
repository.

A column is declared by its type alone: an alias below, or one a domain's `tables.py` adds for a
column only it has. A `KeyPart` is a column of its table's primary key.

Every string column is declared from such a type, and each type has a length. SQLite does not hold
a value to its declared length, so a length is true only where the value's own type is: a
repository key, a slug, a task id and a run id are refused over theirs before they reach a row, a
`Word` is a member of an enum, a `Sha` is a git object name or a SHA-256 digest, and a `Timestamp`
is written by the clock. A `Name` and a `Prose` hold text a caller wrote, which nothing cuts or
refuses by its length yet.

A column the plugin has a default for carries it as a server default, so a row written without the
column reads as one the plugin wrote. A `Timestamp` left out is the time of the write, in the
clock's own form, and a `TextsIfAny` left out is an empty list.

`child_of` is the foreign key of a row that cannot exist without another: it names the parent by
the parent's whole primary key, under the same column names. It is checked when the transaction
commits, so a parent and its child are written in one transaction in either order.
