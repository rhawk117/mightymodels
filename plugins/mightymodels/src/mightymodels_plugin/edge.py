"""What both edges do first: find the repository, name it, and open the database for it.

The server's lifespan and `verify run` start in whatever directory the session did. `open_state`
takes that directory and the plugin data directory the edge read from its environment, and hands
out the workspace at the git toplevel with the database opened under that repository's key, and
the data directory itself for the spool beside the database. So the two edges of one session
open the same file and see the same rows.

Every refusal comes before anything is created: no data directory, no git executable, no work
tree, and a database file of another schema version. Each is a `StateError` naming what is
missing, which the edge shows its caller. An origin remote that is not an owner and a name is no
refusal: that repository is keyed by its toplevel path. Only with the database open is
`.mightymodels/` excluded from git, before anything is written there.
