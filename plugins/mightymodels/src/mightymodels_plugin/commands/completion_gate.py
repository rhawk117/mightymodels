"""The `mightymodels completion-gate` command, which the SubagentStop hook on the implementers runs.

When `mightymodels:engineer` or `mightymodels:architect` stops while a task it started is still
in progress on the ticket whose branch is checked out, and the task's brief has no DONE half that
names a commit (a `commit: <hash>` line under `## DONE`), the stop is blocked once: the command
prints `{"decision": "block", "reason": ...}` and the subagent is sent back to finish. The reason
names each task and what its brief lacks. A fix, a recovery or a review task (`C` and `R` ids) has
no brief and is not held.

The gate keeps no marker of its own. Claude Code sets `stop_hook_active` on the stop that follows a
block, and the gate lets that one through, so a subagent that cannot finish is never trapped.

A worker with nothing in progress, any other agent type and a stop with no ticket, no data
directory, no git work tree or a refused database print nothing and exit 0; the last three say why
on standard error.
