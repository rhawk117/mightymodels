"""The `mightymodels pre-compact` command, which the PreCompact hook runs.

A compaction drops the conversation, so the command writes the snapshot of the ticket whose branch
is checked out before it runs: the same record and Markdown the `snapshot` tool serves, to the
ticket's `handoffs/snapshot.json` and `snapshot.md`, for the next turn to resume from. It reads the
state database and git and writes those two files. A detached HEAD, a branch no open ticket names
and a branch two open tickets name leave everything as it was.

The command never blocks a compaction: no data directory, no git work tree, a refused database or
an unwritable handoffs directory is said on standard error, with exit 0.
