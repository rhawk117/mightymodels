  Build, review, or repair the dispatch packet for a mightymodels worker: choose the right
  worker (code-scout, web-scout, qualitylens, engineer, architect, merge-vader-reviewer,
  uncle-bob-reviewer, gitty-up, wingman), fill its role template, resolve its model from
  ticket.yml, and read the report it returns; also the opening prompt for the next mightymodels
  session. Use whenever you are about to dispatch, re-dispatch, or escalate to a mightymodels
  worker ("dispatch the engineer for task 3", "have a scout find every caller of X", "escalate
  T5 to architect"), when asked which worker should handle something, or when a drafted
  dispatch needs checking before it goes out. Not for writing a prompt a human will paste into
  Claude Code or Copilot; that is ai-engineer's promptlint.

# prompting-subagents

Mightymodels workers are cheap because each does one narrow job from a packet it cannot question: a subagent has not seen this conversation, the ticket, or the diff, and it will act on exactly what the packet says. The failures this skill prevents are all packet failures: the wrong worker for the job, a worker asked for judgment it is built to refuse, a packet missing the one field its worker checks first, a model other than the ticket's, and a report read as more certain than it is. Every worker's standing contract lives in its agent file; the packet carries only what varies per dispatch.

## When it applies

- Before any dispatch to a mightymodels worker, from any mightymodels skill or ad hoc.
- When asked which worker should handle a job.
- When checking or repairing a dispatch someone drafted.
- When writing the opening prompt for the next session (baton-pass).
- Not for a prompt a human will paste into a coding agent; that is ai-engineer's `promptlint`.

## Procedure

1. **Choose the worker.** Route by what you need, not by what feels senior:

   - A fact, location, call-site list, config value, resolved version, git history, or one command's output: **code-scout**. Documented behavior, a default, a deprecation, or a changelog entry for a dependency: **web-scout**, with the version the lockfile pins. One narrow question per dispatch; a "why" or "should" comes back `NEEDS-ANALYSIS`, because that judgment is yours.
   - Code written against acceptance criteria: **engineer**, with an ASKED stanza. One known fix with explicit Fix and Verify lines (a lint failure, a missed verification item, a review finding): **engineer**, residual variant. If the fix is not nameable in a sentence, it is a task, not a residual.
   - An engineer came back `failed` or `blocked`, or a designated reviewer rejected its work for poor code quality with structured evidence: **architect**, once, `recovery-implementation` by default. When architect also fails, the task goes to whats-broken. Never architect for new work.
   - Churn, coupling, or hotspot measurements: **qualitylens**, dispatched by a persona reviewer or review-circus with the script path.
   - A release-readiness or maintainability review: **merge-vader-reviewer** and **uncle-bob-reviewer**, dispatched only by review-circus, which supplies their doctrine paths.
   - Whether CI passed: **gitty-up**, after the PR exists. Its `error` verdict is a stop, never a pass.
   - Verification of an engineer's DONE claims: **code-scout**, DONE against ASKED criterion by criterion. Never let the engineer grade its own work, and never grade it yourself from the diff alone.
   - A stuck judgment call (two defensible options, an expensive-to-reverse choice, conflicting scout reports, two failed attempts): **wingman**, through the ask-an-adult skill, then the user decides.

   Review findings route by risk first: a Critical finding, or a security finding at High or above, goes to a full engineer task whichever reviewer found it. Below that line, uncle-bob findings go to engineer tasks and merge-vader findings to engineer residuals; a `failed` or `blocked` engineer escalates to architect. CI failures route by the log-tail test: a cause obvious from the last screen of the log is an engineer residual; anything needing investigation is whats-broken, not a fixer.

2. **Resolve the model.** Read the active ticket's `subagent-models` block in `.mightymodels/<slug>/ticket.yml` at every dispatch. Ticket values win over the `model:` pins in the agent files; without an active ticket, use the pin. Pass the resolved alias (haiku, sonnet, opus or fable) as the `Agent` tool's `model` parameter, which takes precedence over the agent file's pin. The engineer is sonnet at every scope; a genuinely gnarly engineer task may be bumped one tier up, with the reason logged in its ASKED stanza.

3. **Fill the template.** Read the chosen worker's template in `references/templates/` (one file per worker, named after it) and fill its slots; run its ten-second checklist before sending. Templates exist for `code-scout`, `web-scout`, `engineer` (task and residual), `architect`, `qualitylens`, `reviewer`, `wingman`, and `next-session`. A worker without a template (gitty-up) gets the house format below, not the rough task: gitty-up needs the PR reference and the base branch.

4. **Check the packet** against the house format and the anti-patterns below. This step is also the whole of review-and-repair mode.

5. **Dispatch** with the `Agent` tool: `subagent_type` the plugin-qualified `mightymodels:WORKER` (the bare name is not accepted) and `model` the ticket's alias. Send independent questions in parallel; send a narrower follow-up to the same worker through `SendMessage` instead of a fresh dispatch, its `to` the agent ID or name the first dispatch returned. The worker resumes with its full conversation history, and the `model` given at dispatch still applies (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md, "Resume subagents").

6. **Read the report.** Workers report in XML with a shared vocabulary: `verdict`, `confidence`, `findings`, `follow_up`. Treat `INFERRED` as a hypothesis naming what it rests on, never as a fact; open the cited line yourself before an `INFERRED` finding drives a decision. The full verdict vocabularies and the severity table live in `agents-assemble/references/contracts.md`, which wins whenever a report and this page disagree.

## House format

Trim, well-formed XML sections containing Markdown: the tags give the worker unambiguous boundaries, and the Markdown inside keeps each section readable. Include only the sections that earn their place.

| section          | carries                                                         | include when                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `<objective>`    | what the worker must do and why                                 | always                                 |
| `<context>`      | facts the worker cannot discover: branch, trigger, history      | there are such facts                   |
| `<discovery>`    | what to inspect before acting: paths, symbols, search terms     | the worker searches or reads           |
| `<constraints>`  | owned scope, commit and push instructions, what must not change | the worker edits or runs commands      |
| `<verification>` | exact commands and expected results, with evidence required     | the worker's result must be checked    |
| `<output>`       | only what differs from the worker's standing output contract    | rarely; the contract usually covers it |

State instructions positively, attach a reason to every non-obvious constraint, and never restate the worker's own contract: duplication drifts, and a packet that repeats the agent file buries the lines that vary.

## Anti-patterns

- Dispatching an engineer to answer a lookup: implementation budget spent on retrieval.
- Asking a scout to recommend an approach: `NEEDS-ANALYSIS` at best, laundered guesswork at worst.
- A context-free packet: the worker has not seen the diff, ticket, or ledger, so "check whether the docs are stale" fails where "grep `docs/` and `README.md` for `get_all_tasks`" succeeds.
- A vague residual ("clean this up"): the engineer's owned-file set will refuse it anyway.
- Paraphrasing Fix and Verify lines, reviewer findings, or scout citations: paraphrase is where scope creep and false certainty start. Paste them verbatim.
- Reading gitty-up's `error` as "probably fine".
- Doing a worker's job yourself: committing for an engineer or verifying your own dispatch removes the second pair of eyes the loop is built around.

## Output

The dispatch goes out through the `Agent` tool; in review-and-repair mode, return the repaired packet in a fenced block with one line per substantive change and why it matters. The next-session prompt is printed in chat by baton-pass.
