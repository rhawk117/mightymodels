# whats-broken-solo

The engineer's form of whats-broken, for one worker with no one to dispatch. The rule is the same: **no fix before evidence.** The engineer does not dispatch architect, code-scout or web-scout here; it reads, runs and tests with its own tools. The task tool counts the failed fixes, so the limit holds even when the engineer would rather try one more.

## Steps

**1. Reproduce.** Run the task's failing verification and show its output. When it fails only some of the time, say so with the observed frequency and do not treat it as deterministic.

**2. Evidence.** With `Read`, `Grep` and `Bash`: the failing path, `git log` and `git blame` on it, what the error says against what you assumed it says, and the configuration at the failure site. No fix is proposed in this step.

**3. One hypothesis.** State it once, falsifiable: `I believe <X> is the cause because <evidence>. If true, <Z> will show it.` Two live hypotheses prove neither.

**4. Test it minimally.** The cheapest check that could falsify it: a log line, a narrowed test run. Not a fix. Falsified: back to step 3 with the new evidence. Confirmed: step 5.

**5. Fix inside your owned files, then run the verification again.** A fix that needs a file outside the owned set is not yours to make: report `blocked` with the file and the hypothesis.

**6. Record a fix that failed.** When the verification still fails, call `mcp__plugin_mightymodels_state__failed_fix` with action `record` before you try anything else (`SLUG` is the directory in the brief path `.mightymodels/<slug>/briefs/`, `T1` the task id from the dispatch):

```json
{"action": "record", "slug": "SLUG", "payload": {"task_id": "T1", "change": {"hypothesis": "I believe the batch size is zero because the drain log shows an empty batch; the fix that set it did not change the log"}}}
```

The answer says how many fixes are left. The hypothesis is stored redacted, so keep secrets out of it anyway.

## The limit

The tool stores three failed fixes per task. A fourth call is refused with an error that says the task is blocked and lists the three hypotheses in order. That refusal ends the work: report `blocked`, copy the listed hypotheses into the report, and make no further edit. The coordinator routes a blocked report to architect, then to whats-broken, and the engineer dispatches neither; a hypothesis already tried is not tried again there. The `task` tool is not yours: do not start, mark or verify a task to get around the refusal.
