  Turn an understood problem into a staged unit of work: one ask-user interview (slug, tracker
  GitHub / Jira / both / none, branch, compaction likely, per-task scope), then the ticket
  directory, a Findings rollup from the lets-investigate ledger or what-we-know, the GitHub
  issue and/or Jira ticket (a draft file when the CLI is absent) with a checked tracker body,
  the branch, ticket.yml with derived model routing, and a validated work-unit.json. Ends by
  asking whether to plan now (game-plan), go straight to one-shot, or hand off (baton-pass). Use
  when triage is done: "cut a ticket for this", "open a ticket", "make a jira ticket under this
  epic", "turn this investigation into a ticket", "stage this for the next session", "get this
  ready to implement". Not for starting the implementation itself (game-plan or one-shot), and not
  for handing off an existing ticket (baton-pass).

# open-ticket

Turn an understood problem into a unit of work that this session or a later one can pick up
cold. Everything durable lands in `ticket.yml`, `work-unit.json`, and the tracker; what
happens next is the user's call, asked at the end.

Read `references/ticket-schema.md` and `references/mightymodels-dir.md` before the first run
in a session; they are the contract this skill instantiates. Run the scripts as
`python3 BASE/scripts/NAME.py`, where `BASE` is the `Base directory for this skill` line, from
the repository's working directory.

Nothing under `.mightymodels/` is ever tracked by git. `ticket_state.py` adds `.mightymodels/`
to the repository's local exclude file on every run, so a `git add -A` cannot ship briefs,
reports, or ledgers that may carry raw command output.

## The interview

One ask-user dialog, batched where the tool allows (five sequential dialogs is an
interrogation), containing only the questions the conversation has not already answered.
Answers already given are confirmed in the summary, not re-asked.

1. **Name** this unit of work; propose a slug from the triage target.
2. **Tracker**: GitHub issue, Jira ticket, both, or none.
3. **Branch**: use the current checkout as-is, or create a new branch (propose a name; base
   defaults to HEAD).
4. **Compaction**: would implementing this likely cause at least one compaction?
5. **Scope** of each anticipated task: sm, med, or large.

When the tracker answer includes Jira, ask once, in chat, for the fields in one line: project
key, parent epic, issue type, story points, labels. Take whatever the user gives ("under
PLAT-40, story, 3 points" is a complete answer) and leave the rest unset; the CLI's defaults
and the project's own scheme fill them.

When the caller is baton-pass, the next step is already decided (hand off); do not ask it at
the end.

## The rollup

The tracker body is built from the triage, not from memory of it. Take the findings in this
order of preference:

1. **The investigation ledger.** `python3 BASE/../lets-investigate/scripts/ledger.py knowns --id ID` (`ledger.py list` when the id is unknown). Rows marked `current` are findings.
   Rows marked `lead` were cited at an older HEAD: they go under Open questions as "unverified
   at HEAD", never under Findings, because the ramp would otherwise re-verify the wrong things.
2. **The final what-we-know output** in the conversation.
3. **Cited facts** scattered in the conversation.

From it:

- **Findings**: each current known with its citation, and each user decision. A claim without
  a citation goes under Open questions.
- **`context`** in ticket.yml: one to six lines carrying the knowns and decisions the next
  session cannot afford to lose, without `file:line` (locations rot; the tracker body keeps
  them and the ramp re-verifies them at HEAD).
- **`reference_urls`**: the ledger's resources, external documentation only.
- **`investigations`**: the investigation id, so the work unit links its ledger.

If no triage exists, say so and write the body from what the user has stated, with every
unverified claim marked as such. A ticket that presents guesses as findings sends the next
session confirming the wrong things.

## The actions

**A. Tracker body.** Fill `assets/tracker-body.md` from the rollup into
`.mightymodels/SLUG/issue-body.md`: Summary, Findings, Open questions, Acceptance as checkable
criteria where the triage established them, and a Security surface section only when the
change crosses a trust boundary, adds an input source, or touches authz or secrets (two to five
abuse cases phrased as candidate acceptance criteria; omit the section otherwise, since
inventing threats for a docs change teaches readers to skip the section that matters). Then:

```bash
python3 BASE/scripts/humanize_tracker_body.py fix .mightymodels/SLUG/issue-body.md
```

`fix` repairs dashes and filler openers itself and reports what still needs rewording (tell
words, uncited findings, placeholders, missing sections). Reword those, then run `check` until
it exits 0. No body reaches a tracker before it passes.

**B. Tracker.**

- *GitHub issue.* Discover the repo's conventions first: templates under
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, labels in recent issues, title style from `gh issue list`. Create
  with `gh issue create --body-file .mightymodels/SLUG/issue-body.md`. If `gh` is unavailable
  or fails, keep the file and surface the exact command.
- *Jira ticket.* Check for the `jira` CLI with `command -v jira`. When present, discover the
  create command's flags from `jira issue create --help` rather than assuming them (custom
  fields such as story points are mapped per installation), then create with the fields the
  user gave and the checked body. When the CLI is absent or the create fails, write
  `.mightymodels/SLUG/jira-ticket.md` carrying the fields as a header block, the body, and the
  exact command, and say so in the summary.
- *Both.* Create the GitHub issue first, then the Jira ticket with the issue URL in its body,
  so the two link one way and the sprint's checklist has one home (the GitHub issue).

**C. Branch.** *New*: create and push it; a rejected push (no remote, no auth) is a note in the
summary, not a blocker, since the branch exists locally. *Current checkout*: record the
current branch name and create nothing. A detached HEAD is not a checkout the sprint can run
on; say so and ask for a branch.

**D. ticket.yml.** Write it from the answers, the rollup, and the tracker keys:

```bash
python3 BASE/scripts/ticket_state.py write --slug SLUG <<'JSON'
{"summary": "...", "scope": "med", "compaction": false, "branch": "fix/...",
 "context": ["...", "..."], "issue": 42, "jira": "PLAT-41",
 "reference_urls": ["https://..."], "investigations": ["20260928-..."]}
JSON
```

The script derives the engineer and architect models and `plan-first` per the schema, and
refuses to overwrite an existing ticket.yml. Tell the user the file exists and pause: they
tweak it by hand before anything else happens, and their edit wins over the derivation.

**E. Validate and stage.** After the tweak pass:

```bash
python3 BASE/scripts/ticket_state.py validate --slug SLUG
```

It parses ticket.yml in the canonical subset the schema describes, checks every field and
every linked investigation, and writes `work-unit.json`. A hand edit outside the subset is
reported with its line; fix it rather than working around it. The ticket is not staged until
this passes.

## What next

Ask once, through the ask-user dialog:

- **Plan now**: invoke game-plan in this session. Recommended when `plan-first` is true and the
  context has room for it.
- **One-shot now**: invoke one-shot in this session for a small, well-understood ticket.
- **Hand off**: invoke baton-pass, which writes the next session's prompt.

Close with a summary of what exists and every fallback taken.

## Failure honesty

Every fallback gets surfaced in the closing summary: issue drafted-not-created, Jira ticket
drafted-not-created, branch unpushed, template not found, no triage found to roll up, body
checks still failing, validation not passed. A ticket that silently pretends its side effects
happened strands the next session; the summary is part of the artifact.
