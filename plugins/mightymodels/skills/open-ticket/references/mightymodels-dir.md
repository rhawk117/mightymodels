# The .mightymodels/ directory

Per-ticket files, sparse, organized by unit of work, beside one SQLite database that holds the state. The unit of deletion for files is the unit of work: `/prune-ticket` removes a whole ticket directory, so file rot cannot outlive its ticket. The ticket's rows stay in the database.

The decision and subagent recorder hooks record rows in the database; they arrive with the hooks (surface.md "Hooks").

## Writer/reader matrix: one writer per file class

The database's only writers are the state server's eight tools and `mightymodels verify run`. Each group of tables has one.

## Thinness rule for handoffs

`BATON.md` carries only facts that live nowhere else. It is a bootstrap pointer — read ticket.yml, read issue #N, your role, what to invoke — plus nothing. Duplicated facts drift, and the next session reads ticket.yml first anyway.

## Never tracked

Nothing under `.mightymodels/` is ever committed. The state server at start and `mightymodels verify run` add `.mightymodels/` to the repository's local exclude file (`info/exclude` in the common git dir, so worktrees share it). `briefs/`, `review/`, and the database carry raw command output that can hold secrets, and local-only exclusion means a careless `git add -A` cannot ship them. A later session that finds `.mightymodels/` missing from the exclude file restarts the server, which restores it before anything is written there.
