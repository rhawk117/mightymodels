# `pythonista inspect` reference

Every command prints one compact JSON document on stdout. Run it from the reviewed project's root (the directory holding its `pyproject.toml`), or pass `--root DIR`. A failure the CLI understands prints `pythonista: <message>` on stderr and exits 2. Paths in output are relative to the root and use `/`, except `survey.root` and the config paths inside the gate's argv, which are absolute.

| Command | Exit code | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonista inspect survey` | 0 | Mode evidence, domains, ruff config, layout |
| `pythonista inspect gate --fallback-ruff-config ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/ruff.toml` | 0 passed, 1 a tool failed | Runs the project's own ruff check, ruff format check, ty and pytest |
| `pythonista inspect surface --codebase [PATH ...]` or `--diff BASE [--head REF]` | 0 | Review surface as import-graph clusters, one pylens dispatch each |
| `pythonista inspect facts PATH... [--with-function-shapes]` | 0 | Mechanical AST facts per module |
| `pythonista inspect calls PATH... [--symbol NAME]` | 0 | Per-module coupling metrics and reference tallies; `--symbol` lists one symbol's call sites |
| `pythonista inspect cite DOCUMENT` or `cite -` (stdin) | 0 all hold, 1 any failed | Checks every `path.py:line` citation and its quote in a Markdown document |

A missing target path is an error (exit 2), never an empty result. Files that cannot be read or parsed (bad encoding, syntax errors) are listed under `unparsable` instead of stopping the command.

## survey

```
{root, source_roots[], ruff_config: "ruff.toml" | ".ruff.toml" | "pyproject.toml" | null,
 manifest: {name, requires_python, build_backend, entry_points[], classifiers[],
            dependencies[], dev_dependencies[], optional_dependencies[], declared_distributions[]} | null,
 layout: {has_py_typed, has_dunder_main, has_src_layout, has_tests_directory, has_uv_lock},
 mode: {mode: "library" | "application", reasons[]},
 domains: ["pytest" | "hypothesis" | "sqlalchemy" | "fastapi" | "mcp" | "pydantic" | "msgspec" | "cli" | "asyncio"],
 external_packages[]}
```

`mode` is an inference with its reasons; state the reasons when you state the mode. `dev_dependencies` holds only uv's default groups (`dev` unless `[tool.uv] default-groups` says otherwise); extras and other groups are `optional_dependencies`. `declared_distributions` is what the gate treats as installed with the project. `external_packages` includes the standard library.

## gate

```
{ruff_config_source: "repository" | "fallback" | "defaults",
 results: [{command: {tool: "ruff_check" | "ruff_format" | "ty" | "pytest", program, arguments[], argv[]},
            outcome: {kind: "exited", exit_code} | {kind: "timed_out"},
            output_tail, passed, timed_out}],
 created_paths: {kind: "tracked", paths[]} | {kind: "not_tracked"},
 passed}
```

Declared tools run through `uv run --isolated` (plus `--frozen` when `uv.lock` exists), so the project's pinned versions apply without writing a lockfile, a `.venv` or caches. Undeclared ruff runs through `uvx`; undeclared ty and pytest join the project environment with `--with`. pytest runs only when the survey found the pytest domain. `ruff check` runs with `--statistics`, so its tail is a count per rule. Some build backends still write into the tree (setuptools writes `*.egg-info`): `created_paths.paths` lists every untracked or ignored path that appeared during the run; outside a git repository it is `{kind: "not_tracked"}`. Nothing is deleted. Options: `--skip TOOL` (repeatable), `--timeout SECONDS` (default 600). A `--fallback-ruff-config` path that does not exist is an error (exit 2); a relative one is resolved against the root. The fallback config's `src` is set to the roots the survey found, so first-party imports resolve for the reviewed project.

## surface

```
{target: {kind: "codebase", paths[]} | {kind: "diff", base, head},
 clusters: [{id: "c01", modules: [{path, module, lines}], tests[], dependents[], lines}],
 unparsable: [{path, line, message}],
 options: {max_cluster_lines, dispatch_budget},
 dispatches, line_count, module_count, over_budget}
```

A cluster is a connected group of surface modules that import each other, split when it passes `--max-cluster-lines` (default 1200). `tests` are test modules that import a cluster module; `dependents` are other project modules that import it (callers outside the surface). Modules with no code (empty, comment-only, or only a docstring, such as most `__init__.py` files) are left out. `over_budget` compares `dispatches` with `--budget` (default 24). Several `--codebase` paths form one surface. A diff surface holds only the `.py` files added or modified between `BASE...HEAD`, relative to the root, and is read from the working tree, so HEAD must be the checked-out commit. `--head` without `--diff` is an error.

## facts

```
{modules: [{path, line_count, counts: {kind: n},
            facts: [{line, symbol: "Class.method" | "function" | null, detail: {kind, ...fields}}]}],
 unparsable[]}
```

Kinds and their detail fields: `else_branch` (statement), `while_true`, `break_in_loop`, `return_in_loop`, `match_statement`, `del_statement`, `try_block` (handlers, statements_in_try, caught: list of names), `exception_base_handler` (caught: Exception, BaseException or bare), `raise_without_cause`, `staticmethod`, `classmethod` (returns_cls_call), `private_class`, `dataclass` (frozen, slots, kw_only: each `{kind: "constant", value}` or `{kind: "expression", source}`), `protocol`, `runtime_checkable`, `abc_base`, `handwritten_init` (statements, exception_class), `post_init` (statements), `classvar` (in_dataclass), `operator_overload` (operator), `mutable_default`, `mutable_module_global` (name), `global_statement`, `module_level_call` (call), `sys_path_mutation`, `os_environ`, `lambda_in_collection`, `inline_annotated`, `future_annotations`, `any_annotation`, `typealias_annotation`, `comment` (text), `docstring` (owner), `asyncio_gather`, `asyncio_to_thread`.

`function_shape` (parameters, positional, statements, max_depth, is_async, returns_annotated), one per function, is left out unless you pass `--with-function-shapes`: it is most of the output, and the gate's ruff statistics plus the per-module maxima from `calls` already show where size limits trip. Ask for it on the modules where they do.

Modules come out in path order, each once, however the path arguments overlap. Names match as written: `from asyncio import gather` followed by `gather(...)` is not detected.

## calls

Summary (default):

```
{modules: [{metrics: {path, module, fan_in, fan_out, instability, public_symbols, private_symbols,
                      function_count, max_function_statements, max_parameters, test_paths[]},
            external: [{name, kind: "function" | "class" | "constant", line,
                        referencing_paths[], context_counts: {call?, import?, annotation?, name?}}],
            internal_only: [name],
            unreferenced: [name]}],
 unparsable[]}
```

`external` holds the symbols other files reference, with who references them and how; `internal_only` names symbols used only inside their own module; `unreferenced` names symbols nothing references.

Drill-down (`--symbol NAME`, a bare name or `module.name`):

```
{name, symbols: [{definition: {module, path, name, kind, line, is_public},
                  references: [{path, line, context}], context_counts, reference_count, referencing_paths[]}],
 unparsable[]}
```

A symbol's reference count is the sum of its `context_counts`; it is private when its name starts with `_`. `referencing_paths` leaves out the defining file and includes tests. Resolution is static: imports, aliases and dotted attribute chains are followed; method calls on instances, re-exports through `__init__` and star imports are not. A symbol with no references may still be used dynamically; treat that as a question for pylens, not as proof it is dead. `instability` is `fan_out / (fan_in + fan_out)`, null when both are zero.

## cite

```
{document, checked: int,
 failures: [{citation: {document_line, path, start, end, quote},
             problem: "outside_workspace" | "missing_file" | "unreadable_file"
                    | "line_out_of_range" | "missing_quote" | "quote_not_found"}],
 uncited_rows: [document_line],
 passed}
```

A citation is `path.py:12` or `path.py:12-14`; its quote is the first backticked span after it on the same line, and it is required: a citation without a quote, or with a quote under 3 characters, fails as `missing_quote`. Quotes compare with whitespace collapsed and must appear within the cited lines. Citations inside fenced code blocks are ignored. `uncited_rows` lists Markdown table data rows (outside fences, not header or separator rows) that hold no `path.py:line` citation, such as `#L34` or `:34` styles; `passed` needs no failures and no uncited rows. `checked` counts the citations that were parsed. `cite -` reads the document from stdin, so a pylens return never has to be written to disk. An unreadable document is an error (exit 2).
